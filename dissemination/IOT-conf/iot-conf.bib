Trust management plays an important role in IoT for reliable data fusion and mining, qualified services with context-awareness, and enhanced user privacy and information security. It helps people overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk and engages in user acceptance and consumption on IoT services and applications. However, current literature still lacks a comprehensive study on trust management in IoT. In this paper, we investigate the properties of trust, propose objectives of IoT trust management, and provide a survey on the current literature advances towards trustworthy IoT. Furthermore, we discuss unsolved issues, specify research challenges and indicate future research trends by proposing a research model for holistic trust management in IoT. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

There are however third parties that could benefit from using that data, and the challenge is in allowing them to access it under the conditions that data owners find acceptable. An opportunity presents itself to create a marketplace where device owners could sell that data and data consumers could buy it. Some properties of IoT data make it difficult to trade in traditional data markets. We hypothesise that it is possible to develop an efficient algorithm that responds to data consumer's queries in a way that it's budget constraints are respected and that device owners are compensated for the data they provide. In this paper we create a model of such a market, analyse it's query performance, expected earnings of device owners and utility achieved by data consumers and conclude that data markets in IoT are a viable method of distributing generated measurements.},

MARSA is designed for environments where information technology (IT) infrastructures are not well developed but the need to gather and sell near-realtime data is great. To this end, we present techniques for selecting data types and managing data contracts based on different cost models, quality of data, and data rights. We design our MARSA platform by leveraging different data transferring solutions to enable an open and scalable communication mechanism between sellers (data providers) and buyers (data consumers). To evaluate MARSA, we carry out several experiments with the near-realtime transportation data provided by people in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and simulated scenarios in multicloud environments.},

	abstract = {The continuous global growth of Internet of Things devices and deployments constantly produce an equally growing volume of streaming data. This volume puts high pressure on the cloud infrastructure that is expected to manage the storage and processing of such streams. Special purpose IoT data management platforms such as the IoT Framework which is the system under study in this paper, transform raw streaming data into actual information products thus providing value added services to interested users. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and analyse the impact of the OpenID Connect protocol on the performance of the IoT Framework. The OpenID protocol was introduced in order to enable the IoT framework to be transformed into an IoT Information marketplace. The obtained results show that the introduction of an AA mechanism has a considerable impact on the performance of the IoT Framework. The reason is that the AA server is remote with respect to the IoT platform and therefore the network delay impacts the experienced end to end delay by the user. A possible means to alleviate this problem is to create a local AA server closer to the IoT Platform which either maintains local user AA credentials or federates with other public AA servers.},

In IoT, devices are connected to the Internet and thus are a huge data source for numerous applications. In this article, we focus on addressing data management in IoT through using a smart data pricing (SDP) approach. With SDP, data can be managed flexibly and efficiently through intelligent and adaptive incentive mechanisms. Moreover, data is a major source of revenue for providers and partners. We propose a new pricing scheme for IoT service providers to determine the sensing data buying price and IoT service subscription fee offered to sensor owners and service users, respectively. Additionally, we adopt the bundling strategy that allows multiple providers to form a coalition and offer their services as a bundle, attracting more users and achieving higher revenue. Finally, we outline some important open research issues for SDP and IoT.},

	For example, Gigwalk (http://www.gigwalk.com/) provides a marketplace for sensing tasks performed through smartphones. Mobile users, who have installed the Gigwalk client application, can submit their sensing data and receive rewards.
	
	The selling prices and the corresponding profits are calculated as a function of the total cost, and the device will select a neighbor that has the lowest total cost. Bitmesh (https://www.bitmesh.network/ ) is one of such data forwarding services that can adopt the aforementioned pricing model.

It takes credit scoring-an essential mechanism of the entire world-economic environment, determining access for companies and individuals to credit and the terms under which credit is provisioned-as an example for the realization of the trusted data marketplaces concept. This paper looks at credit scoring from a data perspective, analyzing current shortcomings in the use and sharing of data for credit scoring, and outlining a conceptual framework in terms of a trusted data marketplace to overcome the identified shortcomings. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) identify and discuss the core data issues that hinder innovation in credit scoring; (2) propose a conceptual architecture for trusted data marketplaces for credit scoring in order to serve as a reference architecture for the implementation of future credit scoring systems. The architecture is generic and can be adopted in other domains where data sharing is of high relevance.},
