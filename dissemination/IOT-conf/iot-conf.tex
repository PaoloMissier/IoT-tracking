\begin{abstract}
Internet of Things data are increasingly viewed as a new form of massively distributed and large scale digital assets, which are continuously generated by millions of connected devices.
The real value of such assets can only be realised by allowing IoT data trading to occur on a marketplace that is open to every single producer and consumer, at a very granular level.
Crucially, we believe that such a marketplace should not be owned by anybody, and should instead fairly and transparently self-enforce a well defined set of governance rules.
In this paper we address some of the technical challenges involved in realising such a marketplace.
We leverage emerging blockchain technologies to build a decentralised, trusted, transparent and open architecture for IoT traffic metering and contract compliance, on top of the IoT brokered data infrastructure.
We discuss an Ethereum-based prototype implementation and experimentally evaluate the overhead cost associated with Smart Contract transactions, concluding that a viable business model can indeed be associated with our technical approach.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Much of the expected value associated with the growing industry of Internet of Thing devices \cite{7004800} is to be found in the streams of data generated by those devices.
Application areas where interest in IoT data streams is growing range from health care \cite{7113786} to personal fitness, smart cities \cite{Perera2014}, optimisation of energy consumption in the home, and many more.
In each of these areas, the value of IoT is only delivered when the continuous data streams produced at the edge of the network are aggregated and analysed, either individually or as ``big data'' aggregations over time and over segments of the population.  We refer to these consumers as Value Added Services (VAS).

Some of these applications are just emerging.
For example, in a public transport network like the London underground, the density of personal travel card swipes over time at individual metro stations may be
useful not only to the transportation authority, but also to taxi companies, which can benefit from the knowledge of any anomalous passenger traffic pattern, i.e., by placing their fleet at the right stations at the right time. A VAS that specialises in data analytics may therefore buy metro passenger data together with footfall data collected, for example, through an IoT infrastructure, and sell
recommendation services to taxi companies.

In response to this ``technology push'', new business models are indeed emerging \cite{Stahl2016,7765669} where data are viewed as tradeable digital assets. 
In this paper we propose an initial technical architecture for a new kind of data marketplace that, in the long run, is designed to meet four main requirements.
Firstly, the marketplace should be dynamic and flexible in order to enable the new and un-anticipated kind of business relationships just illustrated. It should be possible to quickly  establish and then fulfil contracts between one and possibly many data producers and the VAS, with guarantees of compliance and fairness.

Secondly, the marketplace should allow not only companies, but also individuals to offer their data. 
%
For example, today it is possible to quantify an athlete's effort during a competition using a number of wearable devices, from bio-harness to accelerometers, to video feeds.
One can imagine that individuals may decide to let VAS access their data feeds, in return for some benefit (monetary or otherwise).
In the near future, athletes may be able to sell these feeds to followers who are interested in tracking their competition online.
There are examples in the UK today, where individuals get heavy discounts on smart watches from health insurance companies, provided they let the company access their fitness data.

Thirdly, the main asset traded in the marketplace are streams of IoT data. This is not usual: a 2012 survey of data vendors \cite{Schomm2013}, for example, includes 46 data suppliers, however the definition of data marketplace used in the paper is generic (``a platform on which anybody can upload and maintain data sets, with license-regulated access to and use of the data'') and geared towards static data, like Microsoft's Azure Data Market.
In contrast, our requirement entails the typical ``Big Data'' challenges of high Volume, high Velocity, and high Variety of the streams.

Finally, it should be possible to run a completely de-centralised marketplace which operates according to governance rules, which determine what kinds of contract and transactions are acceptable, and stipulate sanctions when the rules are violated. 
However, contrary to current proposals, eg \cite{Cao:2016:MMR:2926746.2883611}, we are going to assume  there is no central trusted authority appointed to enforce those rules.
In the paper we focus specifically on this novel aspect. We investigate the use of blockchain (distributed ledger), and specifically of Smart Contracts \cite{Buterin2014}, as a technology enabler for an authority-free, trusted data merketplace.

In summary, we envision a decentralised, self-regulating IoT data marketplace where governance rules are automatically enforced and fairness of the transactions is regulated by means of a trust model amongst participants.

The paper offers the following specific contributions.
%
Firstly,  we present a conceptual model for tracking brokered IoT data flows from gateways to VAS in the cloud, which embodies a methodology to achieve granular metering of IoT data exchanges.

Secondly, we explore the use of blockchain technology and Smart Contracts to remove the need for a centralised trust when settling contracts. 

Thirdly, we present a proof-of-concept implementation of the marketplace enabling architecture. For this, we have adapted the popular open source Mosquitto MQTT broker to add traffic metering capabilities, and use the Ethereum smart contracts technology for enforcing contract definition and providing dispute resolution.

Finally, we carry out an experimental evaluation where we identify the viable boundaries for the prices of digital assets, which make the marketplace economically sustainable relative to the number and frequency of transactions, taking account of the current Ethereum Smart Contract cost model.
We assess the capability of Ethereum Smart Contracts to handle a stream of blockchain transactions at varying arrival rate, and conclude that they are indeed a viable option for the validation of contract compliance.
As the use of Smart Contracts is a novel feature for any IoT architecture, we conclude the paper with a discussion on the challenges and lesson learnt from the use of this emergent technology.

%In the health sector, for example, individuals' activity levels and fitness data, as recorded by smart phones or dedicated fitness devices, may be of interest to health care providers as well as health insurance companies, even if only in anonymised and aggregate form.

The idea of considering data from IoT sensors as tradeable assets is closely related to that of \textit{Sensing as a Service} (SaaS) models, or even \textit{Sensing and Actuation as a service} (SAaaS) \cite{distefano2012sensing}, themselves derivatives of the more general ``Everything as a Service'' (XAAS) cloud-based model for data exchange \cite{5719575}. Perera et al. \cite{Perera2014}, for instance, outline a vision of a near future for Smart Cities, where data streams emanating from pervasive Internet of Things sensors are accessible through services. The SaaS model consists of four conceptual layers: sensors and their owners, sensor publishers, service providers, and sensor data consumers. In this classification, our work is relevant to all of these agents, as it enables fair and metered data exchanges amongst sensors owners and publishers on one side, and sensor data consumers, on the other.

Our traffic monitoring infrastructure assumes that suitable pricing models that associate values to messages are in place.
However, it is agnostic and ``orthogonal'' to the specific pricing model, as long as the price of a complex bundle of data offering can be expressed in terms of unit cost associated to individual messages. 
Thus, in principle, any of the existing models for data pricing may be used in combination with traffic metering. Such models, recently proposed, range from theoretical frameworks for assigning prices to query answers as a function of their accuracy \cite{Li:2014:TPP:2691190.2691191}, to adaptations of \textit{Smart Data Pricing} \cite{Sen:2015:SDP:2847579.2756543} to the dynamic pricing of IoT data, such as personal data from wearable sensors \cite{7437020}.

A trust management model should also be established, i.e., to enable self-regulation of marketplace rules as we briefly discuss at the end of the paper.
Again, while this is out of our scope, existing frameworks can be used on top of out infrastructure.
Yan et al \cite{Yan2014a} provide a starting point, by exploring the notion of trust across the IoT platform layers (physical sensing, network, and application layer), with focus on  a wide range of properties from security to goodness, strength, reliability, availability, ability of data. Interestingly, however, their survey largely overlooks issues of trust amongst participants in a data marketplace, i.e., in the context of data exchange transactions.

More directly useful in our setting, as we progress in our work, is Roman and Gatti's study of trust in data marketplaces \cite{7573695}, based on \textit{credit scoring}, where a direct connection is made to the use of blockchain technology in connection with data trading.

Firstly the MARSA platform \cite{Cao:2016:MMR:2926746.2883611}, designed specifically to deal with real-time data streams by interacting with existing IoT platforms.
The motivation for this work is very similar to ours, namely to provide a marketplace where owners have an incentive to trade their data, for either personal or community benefit.
The many technical requirements that emerge from analysis of data marketplace potential translate into a complex architecture, which includes data flow orchestration, participants registration, data contract management, and payment.  
While these components do address complex marketplace requirements, our main challenge, namely to remove the need for a central trusted authority to manage the marketplace and ensure its fairness, remains unique to our work.

Secondly, Misura, K., \& Zagar \cite{7765669} focus on a query-based mechanism, whereby devices register their data supply capabilities to a broker along with a number of properties, and consumers express interest in data streams by querying those properties. The broker then connects the supplier stream to the consumer, and monitors usage. 
This is relevant work, as this type of matching of consumer data requirements to suppliers capabilities is more sophisticated than simple topic subscription. Our work is complementary to this  and also contributes to remove the trust from the broker for monitoring usage.
In our future work. we plan to move away from a fine-grained data subscription and towards complex data contracts (bundles), as discussed briefly at the end of the paper.

\section{Brokered IoT data as tradeable assets}

We now present our conceptual model for the specification and enforcement of streamed data exchange agreements.
%
Following common IoT infrastructures, we are going to assume that data exchanges are mediated by one or more brokers.
Initially we assume the brokers are trusted. In Sec. \ref{sec:no-trust} we are going to explore the consequences of relaxing this assumption.

\subsection{Contracts and pricing}

Let  $P = \{p_1 \dots p_n \}$ and $C = \{ c_1 \dots c_m \}$ denote the set of producers (IoT devices) and consumers (VAS) that participate in the marketplace, respectively.
%
In the standard publish/subscribe model for data brokering, the $p_i$ act as publishers and the $c_j$ are subscribers.
These participants agree on a set $T = \{ t_1 \dots t_r \}$ of topics.
In IoT data brokering, messages are generated by gateways, which are responsible for segmenting raw data streams from edge devices into discrete messages.
The topic associated with each message describes the type of data stream, for example ``heart rate'', ``GPS track'', ``glucose reading'', ``energy reading'', etc.

Suppose $ p_i $ publishes data on a set of topics $T_{i} \subset T$.
A consumer $ c_j  $ enters into a \textit{contractual agreements} with a producer $ p_i  $ by subscribing to a subset $T_{ij} \subset T_i$ of the topics available from $p_i$, possibly only for the duration of a time window $ W = [w_s, w_e] $.
Such an agreement is interpreted as ``$p_i$ agrees to let $c_j$ receive a copy of all its messages tagged with any $t \in T_{ij}$ during $W$, and $c_j$ agrees to pay a corresponding data exchange fee. 
The broker manages all subscriptions and is responsible for reliably delivering to $ c_j  $ a copy of each message that has a topic that $ c_j $ subscribes to.

Note that in the standard pub/sub model, publishers and subscribers are unaware of one another, and their interaction is entirely mediated by the broker. 
However, it is easy to to extend the model by assuming that the broker will only deliver messages from $ p_i $ to $ c_j $ if $ c_j $ has an active agreement (i.e., relative to $W$) with $ p_i $.\footnote{This can be easily realised in a MQTT-based broker, which we use in our reference implementation.}

%for instance by embedding a device name into a topic tree
%	
%	. When topics are into a hierarchy, 
%
%\textcolor{blue}{To enable explicit marketplace} interactions, we propose a variation of the model whereby every message topic embeds the publisher's ID, which in combination with MQTT's topic regular expressions capability enables a subscriber to selectively choose the stream they intend to license.
%For example, device ``1234'' may publish messages about a specific room's temperature using topic  \#/temperature/1234/living\_room\_temperature. 
%A subscriber may choose to subscribe to this specific topic, or to any  living\_room\_temperature message using expression \#/temperature/*/living\_room\_temperature, or to any generic temperature message from ``1234'' or from any publisher.

%Note incidentally that the model includes the case, not shown in the figure, where a VAS may aggregate data from multiple $ p_i $s and then publish this value-added data, enabling other VAS to license it. 
%In this case, a VAS is both a consumer and a producer.



%While a variety of pricing models have recently been proposed for digital assets in emerging data marketplace scenarios \note{CITE}, discussing how the marketplace sets the data prices is beyond the scope of this work. Instead, we are simply going to assume that each individual message is a digital asset with a constant unit value $\mathit{val}(t_k)$, which is determined solely by the message's topic $t_k$.
A variety of pricing models have recently been proposed for digital assets in emerging data marketplace scenario \cite{Sen:2015:SDP:2847579.2756543,Li:2014:TPP:2691190.2691191,7553037,7437020}.
In this work we are going to assume a simple model where each individual message has constant unit value $\mathit{val}(t_k)$, which is determined solely by the message's topic $t_k$. 
While our infrastructure is largely agnostic to the specific data pricing model, in our evaluation we analyse the economic sustainability of a decentralised marketplace. Specifically, in Sec.\ref{sec:evaluation} we analyse the cost overhead of enforcing agreements given the current cost model associated with Smart Contract transactions.

\subsection{Data traffic cubes and centralised settlement}

Contract enforcement and settlement involves calculating the total price associated with the messages that have been routed from each $ p_i $ to each $ c_j $ within each $W$.
Since we have assumed that the price is  determined only by the number of messages and the unit cost for each topic, this simply requires keeping a count of the number of messages about topic $t_k$ that originated from $p_i$ and reached $c_j$ during $W$, grouped by $ p_i $, $ c_j $, and $ t_k $.
We denote each of these counts as $N_{ijk}(W)$.

Generating these counts requires that the broker be capable of \textit{metering} all traffic, that is, of logging all messages.
The log consists of a set of tuples:
$ \{\langle p_i, c_j, t_k \rangle  \} $

At the end of each $W$, the log is aggregated over each $p_i \in P, c_j \in C, t_k \in T$, resulting in a set of tuples that we call a \textit{traffic cube}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cube}
\mathit{cube}(W) = \{ \langle p_i, c_j, t_k, N_{ijk}(W) \rangle \}_{p_i \in P, c_j \in C, t_k \in T}
\end{equation}

Here we borrow our terminology from standard database practice (OLAP, or Online Analytical data Processing), where a  ``cube'' is a table with $ N $ attributes, in which the first $ N-1 $ attributes are  dimensions in a database schema (in our case, these are the Producers, Consumers (the VAS), and Topics) and the last is an aggregation over values in the database for each combination of the dimensions -- in our case, a count().
We use a matrix indexing notation to refer to specific cells in the cube, i.e.:
\[ \mathit{cube}(W)[p_i, c_j, t_k] = N_{ijk}(W) \] 
These cubes contain summaries of all data flows observed by a broker. Notice that they only contain \textit{metadata}, i.e., the counts, but not the content of the messages.
%
Note that the values in the cube may be sparse, i.e., $N_{ijk}(W) = 0$ whenever $c_j$ does not subscribe to $t_k$.

\textit{Settlement} is the process of calculating the total fee owed by each $ c_j $ to each $ p_i $ at the end of each $W$.
This is computed by suitably aggregating the counts in the cube, namely:
\begin{equation}
\mathit{fee}(c_j, p_i, W) = \sum_{t_k \in T} N_{ijk}(W) \cdot \mathit{val}(t_k)
\label{eq:balance}
\end{equation}
and the total profit for $ p_i  $ during $W$ is
\begin{equation}
\mathit{profit}(p_i, W) = \sum_{c_j} \mathit{fee}(c_j, p_i, W)
\label{eq:reward}
\end{equation}
In the centralised scenario we have considered so far settlement is straightforward, as the broker is entrusted with generating accurate logging and thus complete and correct cubes.
Note that, under the same trust assumptions, settlement extends easily to a more realistic scenario where multiple brokers are deployed, each enhanced with the same logging capabilities and local traffic reporting service.

Hovever, settlement becomes challenging in an extended model where there is no assumption of trust in the broker.
In this case, fee settlement must rely on data traffic counts that are calculated independently by each participant, based on the portions of data flows that are visible to each of them, with the 
further complication that participants cannot be trusted to generate complete and correct cubes.
This de-centralised scenario is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:iot-tracking-arch-2} and discussed in the next Section.

\section{Removing the need  for trust in the network}  \label{sec:no-trust}

A marketplace where the reward model is based on message counts is vulnerable to malicious behaviour.
Specifically, producers have an incentive to claim to have produced more messages than they have in reality, while conversely, consumers (the VAS) have an incentive to under-report the number of messages they receive.
%
When we remove the assumption that the brokers are trusted, we must also accept that the brokers may collude with any of the participants, and thus deliver traffic cubes that may not be correct or complete.
Discovering such collusions may not be possible when the broker is the only source of traffic counts available to the settlement service.  At the same time, resolving any disputes amongst pairs of participants requires a public and irrefutable record of the reported traffic.

To address these problems, we rely on two over-arching principles: (1) personal responsibility of each participant in the marketplace, which shall report their own counts of messages sent (publishers) or received (subscribers) using \textit{edge trusted zones} (see Fig.\ref{fig:iot-tracking-arch-2} and description below),
 and (2) transparency, whereby these reports are posted as part of immutable and verifiable blockchain transactions.
These principles translate into a two-steps approach.
%

Firstly, we remove the assumption that traffic cubes are generated by the broker alone, and instead enable networks elements close to the publishers and to the subscribers, i.e., gateways and VAS respectively, to generate the cubes. This is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:iot-tracking-arch-2}.
%
Secondly, we adopt emerging consensus-based distributed transaction ledgers, specifically blockchain and Smart Contract technology, to realise the settlement service.
As we explain in more detail later (Sec. \ref{sec:blockchain}), Smart Contracts extend the standard blockchain transaction model by adding the capability to execute arbitrary code, which operates on data structures contained in the transaction itself. 
In this case, a blockchain transaction that is initiated at the end of each window $W$ may operate on the collection of traffic cubes that participants make available at the end of $W$.
This  approach provides at the same time transparency and accountability, because the content of the blockchain is public and can be inspected, and a way to address disputes, because for each W, multiple (partial) views of each cube are made available to the settlement service.

\subsection{Unilateral traffic cubes} \label{sec:u-cubes}
%\ag{This sub-section now includes the architecture. It should be integrated in the previous main Section}
Traffic cubes that are generated by the broker summarise the entire traffic during $W$.
In contrast, traffic summaries generated by marketplace participants reflect the \textit{local} views of each participant in the data exchanges.
These are therefore necessarily partial and incomplete, as each participant, unlike the broker, has no visibility of the end-to-end data flows. 
We denote these as \textit{unilateral} traffic cubes, defined as follows.
Let us assume that a producer does not know which VAS subscribe to its stream, while subscribers know the source of the messages they receive. 

Let $\mathit{sub}(t_k) \subseteq C $ denote the set of subscribers to $t_k$.
%
A \textit{publisher's cube} $\mathit{cube^p}$ is a slice of a complete traffic cube, for a specific producer $p_i$ and without the consumer dimension:
\[
\mathit{cube}^p(W, p_i)  =  \{ \langle t_k,  N^s_{ik}(W) \rangle \}_{t_k \in T}
\]
where $N^s_{ik}(W)$ is the count of messages with topic $t_k$ sent by $p_i$ during $W$.
Note that $ p_i $ can compute $ N^s_{ik}(W)  $ from its own data flow log, but not $ N_{ijk}(W)  $.


As subscribers know the source of the messages they receive, we may assume that a subscriber will produce summary reports that include the publisher dimension, but which only contain the tuples that pertain to a single $c_j$. Thus, a \textit{subscriber's cube}, $ \mathit{cube^s} $ is defined as:
\[
\mathit{cube^s}(W, c_j)  =  \{ \langle p_i, t_k, N_{ijk}(W) \rangle | c_j \in \mathit{sub}(t_k)\}_{p_i \in P, t_k \in T}
\]

\end{figure*}

Figure 1 concretely illustrates this setting. To remove the need for a centralised trust, we push it towards the borders of the data flow network by defining two \textit{trusted zones}.
The first trusted zone includes all the elements at the edge of the network infrastructure, such as the IoT devices $P$ and the gateways $ G_i $, whereas the second one includes $ C $.
%The latter range from monitoring, to health applications, assets tracking, smart city applications, etc.
IoT data are still routed towards the VASs through brokers--using a publish-subscribe pattern--or network servers.
However, we now assume that a new, independent IoT data tracking component receives the unilateral cubes by gateways and VASs.
Finally, a Smart Contract deployed on a blockchain periodically accesses the traffic cubes to realize settlement services and resolve possible conflicts.

\subsection{Consistency and settlement with unilateral cubes}

Suppose that, at the end of $W$, every $p_i$ and $c_j$ produce  unilateral cubes relative to $W$. 
These form the set
\begin{equation}\label{eq:all-cubes}
\{ \mathit{cube}^p(W, p_i) \}_{p_i \in P}\cup \{\mathit{cube^s}(W, c_j) \}_{c_j \in C} 
\end{equation}
As each of these cubes provides a partial view of the same complete cube $ \mathit{cube}(W) $ that would have been generated centrally by a broker, we expect that the values found in these cubes be somehow consistent with $ \mathit{cube}(W) $.

The pub/sub model implies that the number of messages sent by $p_i$ with topic $t_k$ during $W$ must be equal (assuming no messages are lost and ignoring duplicate transmissions, as in MQTT QoS level 3) to the number of messages each $c_i$ that subscribes to $t_k$ receives from $p_i$. 
We can capture this constraint formally using our cubes notation, as follows.
%
For each $ p_i \in P, t_k \in T, c_j \in \mathit{sub}(t_k)$:
{\begin{equation}\label{eq:cubes-consistency}
\begin{split}
& \mathit{cube}^p(W, p_i)[t_k] = N^s_{ik}(W) = \\
& \mathit{cube}(W)[p_i, t_k, c_j]  = N_{ijk}(W) = \\
& \mathit{cube^s}(W, c_j)[p_i, t_k]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%\vspace{-10pt}
%\begin{definition}
We say that the set (\ref{eq:all-cubes}) of all unilateral cubes is \textit{consistent} at $W$, if and only their contents satisfy constraint (\ref{eq:cubes-consistency}).
%\begin{end}
We use this definition as a basis for settlement of message exchanges within each $W$, in the general case that the broker cannot be trusted to provide a single global cube that is complete and correct.
%
Specifically, in our architecture we  now assume that a new, independent component receives all cubes in (\ref{eq:all-cubes}) at the end of each $W$, and checks their consistency using (\ref{eq:cubes-consistency}). 
In the next section we discuss a practical implementation of this idea, where this new component is realised as a Ethereum Smart Contract and unilateral cubes are posted publicly as part of blockchain transactions. As explained in more detail later, a Smart Contract is a script that operates on the blockchain.   
It can be viewed as a third party trusted service, because its implementation is transparent and agreed upon by all marketplace participants.

In this decentralised scenario, such a settlement service must be able to deal with two inter-dependent issues, namely (a) \textit{completeness} and (b) \textit{consistency} of the set (\ref{eq:all-cubes}) of all cubes.

The case when set (\ref{eq:all-cubes}) is both complete and consistent is straightforward and results in successful settlement, as all information for settlement is available, and there are no disagreements.

When the set of cubes is incomplete, we may try to use (\ref{eq:cubes-consistency}) to propagate missing values from the more complete to the less complete cubes. 
More precisely, suppose $ \mathit{cube}^p(W, p_i) $ is missing for a $p_i$.
If $ N_{ijk}(W) = \mathit{cube^s}(W, c_j)[p_i, t_k] $ is available for some $t_k$ and some $ c_j \in \mathit{sub}(t_k) $, then we set $  \mathit{cube}^p(W, p_i)[t_k]=  N_{ijk}(W) $.
In practice, this can be viewed as ``taking $ c_j $s word for $p_i$s missing report''.

Symmetrically, the settlement service may use the available $ \mathit{cube}^p(W, p_i)$, in combination with subscription information $ \{\mathit{sub}(t_k) | t_k \in T \}$, to fill in missing values in 
$  \mathit{cube^s}(W, c_j)  $, i.e., by setting 
$ \mathit{cube^s}(W, c_j)[p_i, t_k]  =  \mathit{cube}^p(W, p_i)[t_k]$ for each $t_k$ and each $c_j \in \mathit{sub}(t_k)$.
%
Of course, there is no guarantee that all missing values can be propagated. 
In this case, settlement for the $\langle p_i, c_j \rangle$ pairs corresponding to the missing cube entries is simply not possible.

The final, and perhaps more important case occurs when constraint (\ref{eq:cubes-consistency}) is violated for some combination of $\langle p_i, c_j, t_k \rangle$.
This may be due to the malicious cases of over-reporting producers, or under-reporting subscribers.
%
Either of these  scenarios manifests itself as inequalities in (\ref{eq:cubes-consistency}), of the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inconsistencies}
\mathit{cube}^p(W, p_i)[t_k] > \mathit{cube^s}(W, c_j)[p_i, t_k]
\end{equation}
In this situation, we are able to detect the inconsistency, but we may not have enough information to determine whether $p_i$, $c_j$, or both are guilty of fraud.
Such determination is beyond the scope of this paper, but in the final discussion section we present initial ideas on promoting a self-regulating marketplace in the presence of such unresolvable inconsistencies.
%
In our initial implementation, described next, the settlement service simply reports the detected inequalities.

\section{Conclusion and future work}
Our initial work encourages us to further develop the idea of a decentralized data marketplace, where benefits such as interoperability, transparency and fairness are achievable and cost affordable. However we recognized that the cube settlement component is a very important but still only one building block of such an infrastructure, in which less-critical centralized and decentralized elements will have to be combined. In future we plan to experiment and test the effectiveness of the reputation based reconciliation strategy and to develop the complete architecture for a trusted and transparent data marketplace. This will include Data Producers and VASs discovery service, contract creation and discovery platform and the definition of an open governance model associated to it, promoting public and open creation and review of settlement contracts (similar to the github model, https://github.com).
